# AAIT - Advanced AI Techniques

## HW1 - RL Crafter Project

Implement, train and evaluate a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent for playing the game of [Crafter](https://github.com/danijar/crafter) better than a random policy. [Crafter](https://github.com/danijar/crafter) can be seen as a simpler, 2D version of Minecraft, and it shares with it the procedural generation of maps at every episode and some of the complexity of its technological tree. <br>

The project source code, presentation and any other relevant information can be found in [Tema1](Tema1/).


## HW2 - Image classification with messy data

The tasks covered in this project involve the problem of image classification when encountering datasets that are not as neat and tidy - some of the samples are not annotated or the target labels are just wrong. <br>

### Tasks

- Image classification with missing labels
- Image classification with noisy labels

The source code for both tasks can be seen in [Tema2](Tema2/) directory and for a detailed presentation of the implemented approaches and an analysis of the results, please consult the [experimental report](Tema2/Experimental_report/Experimental_report_Andrei_Dugaesescu_IA2.pdf).
